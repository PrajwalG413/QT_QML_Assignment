# QT_QML_Assignment

Hello, This is Prajwal G(24296).

1.#Internationalization_with_Qt:
    I have followed all the steps you have mentioned and created this project from scratch.
    I have removed ComboBox instead used RadioButton and grouped them to change langauge and also added Japanese language.
    
2. #Start_Stop_and_Restart_QMutex_QThread:
    This Project was done by Prajwal G, Harikrishnan B and Ananthu S Ajayan.
    Here we have added Restart button and also added functionality to continue count after stopping.
    
3. #Signal_Slot_and_QINVOKABLE:
    I have used signal_slots and also using Q_INVOKABLE [Please uncomment lines specified in project].
   
4. #Signal_Slot_QPROPERTY_and_qmlRegisterType:
    I have used Q_PROPERTY and also to create custom components using qmlRegisterType() [Please uncomment lines specified in project].

5. #ListOfObjects_cpp_QML:
    I have used QLIST to create 5 objects and passed it to QML from Cpp and used QQuickView::setInitialProperties().
