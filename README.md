# QT_QML_Assignment

Hello, This is Prajwal G(24296).
I Have added projects based on last two days and also added all other assignment questions given and also commented wherever necessary in code.

For any queries or issues please write to me at prajwalg0413@gmail.com 

1. Internationalization_with_Qt:

    I have followed all the steps you have mentioned and created this project from scratch.
    I have removed ComboBox instead used RadioButton and grouped them to change langauge and also added Japanese language.
    
2. Start_Stop_and_Restart_QMutex_QThread:
    
    Has mentioned while training this Project was done by Prajwal G, Harikrishnan B and Ananthu S Ajayan.
    Here we have added Restart button and also added functionality to continue count after stopping.
    
3. QMutex_Simple_Example:

    I have created 3 thread instances and started them using QMutex.
    
4. UnitTest_Simple:

    Based on your Explaination I have created a simple Unit test class and created some testcases.
    In this I have intentionally failed two testcases so that we can understand how testcases fail.
    
5. Unit_Test_Calculator:

    Implemented same code you have done in training, but added testcases for Diff, MUl, and Div (checked for divide by '0' using QVERIFY).
    
5. Signal_Slot_and_QINVOKABLE:

    I have used signal_slots and also Q_INVOKABLE [Please uncomment lines specified in project].
   
6. Signal_Slot_QPROPERTY_and_qmlRegisterType:

    I have used Q_PROPERTY and also to register class as a component or to create custom components using qmlRegisterType().
    [Please uncomment lines specified in project].

7. ListOfObjects_cpp_QML:

    I have used QLIST to create 5 objects and passed it to QML from Cpp and used QQuickView::setInitialProperties().
8. ToggleColors:

    I am changing color of rectangle on button click [Used Qt Quick UI Prototype project].
